# generator-hex
> Project generator for hexMachina framework

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-hex using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g https://github.com/DoclerLabs/generator-hex.git
```

Then use the hexMachina generator like this:

```bash
yo hex
```

You can also run a sub-generator directly like this:

```bash
yo hex:module
```

Make sure to run file generators from your source folder.

For even more convenient use, a FlashDevelop plugin will be available soon.
